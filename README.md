# openmetalyoshi
A fork of the original Metal Yoshi project, designed to be used as a basis for new, better Discord bots!

## Required modules:

discord.js

fs

os

booru (for booru-retrieving functionality)

embed-creator

snekfetch

## Disclaimer:
This project, in it's current, rawest state, does not work properly. This fork is from a way older version of Metal Yoshi, and I haven't cleaned it up. If anyone is willing to help clean up and improve this code, please submit pull requests!
